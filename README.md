## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

The primary goal was to develop and implement an advanced workflow for Synthetic Human generation, with a focus on minimizing human intervention and ensuring an efficient, flexible process. 
This project aimed to transform RAIâ€™s vast archive of images and videos resources into a valuable asset for creating photorealistic 3D avatars of significant personalities, such as historical figures or past celebrities.

#Automated 3D Head Reconstruction 
This was achieved through the Orchestrator, developed in partnership with PluxBox for the IBC2023 Accelerator Project. The Orchestrator is a sophisticated technological tool that integrates various stages - from image selection to super-resolution, culminating in three-dimensional face reconstruction. Automation in Face Reconstruction was facilitated by a script provided to the Orchestrator via Rest APIs, employing Blender FaceBuilder plugin's functionalities to create 3D face meshes from 2D images.

#Face Texture Reconstruction
The project also emphasized improving textures using Stable Diffusion and Artificial Intelligence to generate images of the reference subject. AI-generated images were found to be more suitable for texture production than traditional methods. This phase benefited from the refinement of LoRA training models, enabling the creation of realistic, detailed images crucial for generating uniform textures in Synthetic Human creation.

## Built With

Major Frameworks Utilized in the Project:

Through the Stable Diffusion Web UI provided by Automatic1111 it is possible to download and run Stable Diffusion locally. 

The Low-Rank Adaptation training was conducted using the Kohya Trainer, available on Google Colab. 
Approximately 80 images of the chosen subject were used for the training, usefull info can be found in this video.
After training the LoRA models using the Kohya Trainer, the resulting TensorFlow files of the subject were directly integrated into the local installation of the Stable Diffusion Web UI in the "stable-diffusion-webui/models/Lora" directory, enabling the usage of these custom-trained models in the SD WebUI.

The Realistic Vision V5.1 model is specifically designed and optimized for generating high-resolution, photorealistic images. This model is a critical component in achieving high-quality, results, and it functions within the stable diffusion framework, once downloaded, the model file needs to be placed in the "models/Stable-diffusion" directory the local installation of the Stable Diffusion Web UI.
Once the Web UI recognizes the new model, you can select it from the Stable Diffusion checkpoint input field. This step is crucial as it tells the system which specific model to use for generating images.
